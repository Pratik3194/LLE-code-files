# Low_light_image_enhancement

Images have a wide range of applications in the field of engineering like in medical field, remote sensing, transmission and encoding, machine vision, robotics, pattern recognition, etc.

In some cases, the images captured by cameras contains blur, noise and low lightness in it. This causes difficulty to viewer in extracting the information from it.There can be many causes of this problem like low light environment, poor performance of the equipment, inappropriate configurations of the equipment.

The objective of this case study is to build a model(Deep Retinex Decomposition model) using deep learning techniques like CNN, Encoder-decoder that will learn from the existing dataset of low and high quality images and will be able to convert any poor quality image given to it into the high quality image.
